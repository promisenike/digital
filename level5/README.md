## Digital Systems (Level 5)
This is part of a level 5 course in digital systems engineering using Verilog and System-Verilog. These notes form part of a taught module on real-time sytems at the [University of Plymouth (UK)](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/school-of-engineering-computing-and-mathematics/electronics-robotics).

It is assumed the student is knowledgable in digital electronics, including the fundamentals of combinational and sequential logic.
